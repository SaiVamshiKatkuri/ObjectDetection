# Hey Folks!
## ObjectDetection using CNN
- **The project is based on the dataset CIFAR-10 that consists of 60000 images with 10 different objects in it.**
- **Classes in the dataset**
<ul>
  <li>Automobile</li>
  <li>Bird</li>
  <li>Cat</li>
  <li>Deer</li>
  <li>Dog</li>
  <li>Frog</li>
  <li>Horse</li>
  <li>Ship</li>
  <li>Truck</li>

  </ul><br>
  
- *I have used Convolutional Neural Networks for detetction of the objects.*

- *This is a Multi class classification task where we use softmax function instead of Sigmoid.*

## Look over the function

- *The model approximately took three hours of training and gave an accuracy of `90%`*
